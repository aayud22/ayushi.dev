This file is a placeholder. In a real project, you would replace these with actual images:

- profile.jpg - A professional headshot for the About section
- project1.jpg through project6.jpg - Images showcasing your projects
- map.jpg - A map image for the contact section

For testing purposes, you can use placeholder image services like:
- https://picsum.photos/
- https://placeholder.com/
- https://placehold.co/

Example usage in Next.js Image component:
<Image 
  src="https://picsum.photos/600/400" 
  alt="Project" 
  width={600} 
  height={400} 
/>
